First try at a small RPG game created using pygame. Repo may end up getting kinda messy by accident.

Here I will keep a day by day history of changes made to the project,

2/13/15 Project creation.. First ideas developed and beginning work on pauseMenu.py, along with several other classes

2/14/15 New Project approach.. Looking at new way of creating start menu by having each option set up separately. Build each panel of menu into separate Rect objects
